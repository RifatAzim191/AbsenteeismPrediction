**Dataset:** 
There are no suitable and reliable dataset on student-absenteeism thus I made a dataset of my own. 
I collected the data from 2500 students of North South University who voluntarily participated to help me create the dataset.
In this dataset, there are 7 features (PHI, MHI, FI, LD, UE, SCI, TI) and 1 target variable (APM).
**Methodology:**
After preprocessing the data, we balanced the data using "SMOTE" and then trained various Machine Learning models.
Random Forest gave us 77% accuracy, which is the highest accuracy score among the ML models.
